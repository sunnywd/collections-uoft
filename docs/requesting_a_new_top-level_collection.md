# Requesting a new top-level collection

Before requesting a new top-level collection in Collections U of T, review the [service parameters](https://github.com/utlib/collections-uoft/blob/main/README.md#about-collections-u-of-t) to make sure Collections U of T fits your needs.

U of T libraries and archives can request use of Collections U of T any time by emailing digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca with their request, including the following information:

* Title of the new top-level collection (usually the name of the library/archives)
* Brief description to the collection (this will be included on your top-level collection page)
* PID of collection (this will be included in the URL for your top-level collection and *cannot* be changed once it is published)
* Approximate size (MB, GB, or TB) of images you are initially planning to ingest (we may need to increase storage, depending on your collection size)
* Confirmation that the image collections you will be ingesting are:
      intended for long-term, public, and perpetual acess
      cleared for accessibility, privacy and copyright considerations. You must follow Canadian Copyright law when uploading digital images into Collections U of T. If you do not hold the rights to publish the material online, permission must be obtained.
      not duplicates of existing items already in Collections U of T under another library/archives' collection
      not being stored in Collections U of T for preservation (it is not a preservation repository)
* Emails for staff who will require access to the Collections U of T administration back end

**Note: because of service capacity, approving your request, onboarding staff, and setting up your new collection may take 2-8 weeks to complete.**

To have your request for a new top-level collection in Collections U of T approved, please ensure:
* You commit to following Collections U of T policies and procedures, both existing policies and with an understanding that service policies may evolve.
* You have staff members available who are familiar with metadata best practices and can follow Collections U of T metadata guidelines. You must have staffing capacity to support the care and maintenance of the digital collection over time - ITS cannot maintain any collections or web content you create in Collections U of T. If you do not maintain your content, it may be taken offline.
* You have time available before your collection is set up to meet with a Collections U of T service representative to talk through policies and training.
* You commit to joining the [Collections U of T Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a0c2caaac27a04fe7b6e37018970a66b5%40thread.tacv2/Collections%2520U%2520of%2520T?groupId=2151c2c7-2063-412d-8ebf-de2c9f809003&tenantId=78aac226-2f03-4b4d-9037-b46d56c55210) to follow service updates (this will be in use after 2024 launch).
