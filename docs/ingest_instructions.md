# Ingest instructions

New Collections U of T infrastructure will be launched in 2023 as the UTL ITS team completes its migration off of Islandora 7 (Drupal 7). 

Manual ingests by UTL ITS are possible during this migration period. 

Please clear all copyright and privacy considerations for the collection before submitting the images to Collections U of T for online public access.

To ingest into an existing top-level collection, [contact us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) with the following details:

**If creating a new collection, include:**
1. Title of the collection
2. Brief description to the collection (to be included in the collection's metadata description)
3. PID of collection
4. Related catalog record catkey, permalink, or any “Part of” links - i.e. corresponding Discover Archives finding aid or link to external collection website
5. Call number
6. Path to the completed [metadata spreadsheet](https://github.com/utlib/collections-uoft/blob/main/docs/metadata_template_instructions.md)
7. Path to the directory where the images are stored (you must ensure image filenames match metadata spreadsheet filenames)
8. Deadline for ingest to help us prioritize and schedule the work

**If adding to an existing collection, include:**
1. PID of the collection you are adding to
2. Path to the completed [metadata spreadsheet](https://github.com/utlib/collections-uoft/blob/main/docs/metadata_template_instructions.md)
7. Path to the directory where the images are stored (you must ensure image filenames match metadata spreadsheet filenames)
8. Deadline for ingest to help us prioritize and schedule the work

This page will be updated with self-ingest instructions when the new Collections U of T infrastructure is launched.
