# What is IIIF?

[IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)](http://iiif.io/) is a set of APIs and related tools created by an international community of leading cultural institutions. The IIIF community has created documentation to help you learn how to use the [IIIF APIs](https://iiif.io/get-started/how-iiif-works/), how to use the [IIIF Mirador viewer](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/#mirador), and how to [find other IIIF digitized collections](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/) from cultural heritage institutions across the globe. Below you will find additional IIIF documentation specific to Collections U of T and the University of Toronto's IIIF digital collections.

## IIIF in Collections U of T

Each digitized object in Collections U of T has something called a **IIIF manifest**. On each digital object's view page, you will see a *Copy IIIF Manifest* button in the top right corner of the display.

This button is intended to make it easy for you to copy IIIF manifests for digital objects you are interested in reusing. IIIF manifests contain information about the images and metadata for digitized objects. By copying a digital object's manifest, you can paste the manifest URL into a IIIF-enabled tool to reuse the digitized objects's images in a way that meets your research, teaching, or personal interest needs.

## Collections U of T URL paths

The URL path for a digital object is always `https:/collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/**PID**` - where PID is the identifier for the digital object.

Similarly, The URL path for a digital object's manifest is always `https://iiif.library.utoronto.ca/presentation/**PID**/manifest` - where, again, PID is the identifier for the digital object.

Note that IIIF collections manifests follow a different URL pattern. Collection manifests are always `https://iiif.library.utoronto.ca/presentation/collections/**PID**` - where PID is the identifier for the digital collection.

You can also access **all** Collections U of T IIIF manifests at [https://iiif.library.utoronto.ca/presentation/v2/collections](https://iiif.library.utoronto.ca/presentation/v2/collections).

## Where can I find copyright and reuse information in Collections U of T? 
Every collection differs in rights and reuse guidelines. Some collections do not allow for reuse, while others do. For any digital object you are interested in reusing, please refer to the \"Rights\" field in the digital object(s) "information" section of the image viewer. 

![The Rights information for the 2001-15-2MS of University College from the University of Toronto Archives](img/3_rights_a.png)

Some collections may not have rights information. For these, a contact email is given. When in doubt, use the contact information to connect with library and archives staff about reuse and permissions.
