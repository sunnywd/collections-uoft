# Transcribing and Annotating Collections U of T Images

This page compiles an ongoing list of transcription and annotation tools that can be used with Collections U of T images. 

For Collections U of T purposes, we are interested in tools that are designed to work with [IIIF](https://iiif.io) and follow the [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model) - coming out of the [W3C Open Annotations Community](https://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/). 

Collections U of T does not currently support TEI xml. 

Please note: collection owners should only upload final, complete transcriptions into Collections U of T. Transcriptions are displayed publicly and indexed for search. It is possible to reuse Collections U of T objects in course content or transcribe-a-thons - but the resulting text from these should not be ingested into Collections U of T before review by collection owners. Content should be approved for public display and search indexing before being added to Collections U of T.

## From The Page

As example, the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library has purchased a From The Page membership account for their transcription work. The profile is available at https://fromthepage.com/utl

Other collection owners are encouraged to assess if From The Page meets their use case and context. From The Page offers trial accounts for testing.

12\. And you will see the IIIF manifest imported into From The Page for you to begin transcription! Transcription guideline suggestions, outlined by the Fisher:
* Transcription of texts is NOT an exact science, but the more you do over time, the better you’ll be! It’s important to recognize the idiosyncratic ways in which writers wrote, so look for their peculiarities in forming certain letters and then you can apply that knowledge elsewhere in the same document when you come up with a tough word. Sometimes you just have to go a letter at a time!
* Most of the manuscript documents were composed on rough paper with quill pens. In trying to figure out a letter or word, it helps to think of how the letters are formed. Lighter, thinner strokes are usually upstrokes and thicker strokes are usually downstrokes.
* Save your work regularly - After completing any transcription, remember to hit the save button to ensure that your work is preserved.
* Transcribe what you see: Forget about standardized spelling and punctuation. Every individual scribe has an individual, inconsistent hand and approach to spelling so just transcribe what you see. Resist the urge to modernize spelling or to correct mistakes. Type words exactly as they are presented, including capitalization, abbreviations, names, and dates. Upper and lower case letters are often used inconsistently.
* Use complete words: Often, a writer will break and hyphenate a word when moving from one line to the next. Don't preserve these breaks; just write the complete word. This will better enable researchers to run effective word searches later.
* Bracketing: Use square brackets to indicate that a word or phrase is unclear to you. When you encounter words or phrases that you can't make out, just use double brackets to indicate this (i.e., "[[unclear]]"). If you can propose a reasonable guess, place your guess in double brackets with a question mark following it (e.g., [[barn?]]). In either case, please highlight your guess in yellow so it can be checked later for a possible resolution.
* Indicate the presence of sketches or doodles with a note:-If you encounter a sketch or doodle on a manuscript page, indicate this by placing the word image in the double brackets (e.g. "[[image]]"). If you feel that you can make out what the image is, place your guess in the double brackets as well (e.g. "[[cat--image]]").
* Transcribe as much as you can on a page and then move on: In general, you should try to finish page transcriptions if you can, but if you feel bored or confused by a particular page, just move on to a different one. You can always return to it later.
* Don't attempt to format text: There is no need to indicate line breaks, indents, underlining, etc. Remember, the goal is to make the digitized manuscript searchable; users will be able to view the page image itself, so describing the appearance of the text is unnecessary.
* Rely on context to decipher words: Handwriting can be difficult to read. Look for similar words or letters in the document that may help you to decode the handwriting.
* Don’t be afraid to use Google: Sometimes there will be personal names that might seem undecipherable in your texts. When that happens, feel free to use Google by combining the name you think you see with the author, place, subject, or the event and very often you will get a match.
* Remember: some access is better than none. If your work isn't perfect or if you're unable to complete a page; others can review your work and edit or add to your transcription later.
