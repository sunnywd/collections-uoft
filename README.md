# Collections U Of T - Metadata Templates

This Github repository contains public Collections U of T metadata templates and work flow documentation to support University of Toronto staff in using Collections U of T. 

[Collections U of T](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca) is the  University of Toronto Libraries repository for digitized special collections and archives image collections. Collections U of T delivers image collections through the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/) and standard metadata formats.

Collections U of T provides service users:

1. Collection management and digital object storage for university special collections and archives image collections
2. Indexing for digital object metadata
3. Search and discovery for collections and digital objects
4. User management and authentication (CRUD for collections and digital objects)
5. Statistics for collections and digital objects

Collections U of T is not:
* A digitization service
* A digital exhibit service
* A digital preservation service
* Open to anyone - digital collections must be assessed prior to inclusion (they are assessed for privacy, copyright, staffing capacity to support ingest, etc.)
