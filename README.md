# Collections U Of T

This documentation is intended for collection owners, end users, and open technology community members interested in Collections U of T.

[Collections U of T](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca) is the  University of Toronto Libraries' repository for digitized special collections and archives. It provides open access to these digital collections through the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/) and standard metadata formats.

Collections U of T provides U of T staff:

1. Collection management and digital object storage for university special collections and archives image collections
2. Indexing for digital object metadata
3. Search and discovery for collections and digital objects
4. User management and authentication (CRUD for collections and digital objects)
5. Statistics for collections and digital objects

Collections U of T is not:
* A digitization service
* A digital exhibit service
* A digital preservation service
* Open to anyone - digital collections must be *assessed* prior to inclusion. Because the service is intended for providing long term discovery and display of access copies of digital collections, the digital objects must belong to a UTL department or archives and be assessed by a UTL staff collection owner prior to inclusion. UTL collection owners are responsible for assessing digital objects for accessibility, privacy and copyright considerations, as well as staffing capacity to support the care and maintenance of the digital collection over time. 

## Metadata and Data Model

The Collections U of T data model is available upon request.

## Descriptive Metadata Standards

Descriptive metadata is also converted to JSON in Collections U of T IIIF manifests for display purposes. 

Collections U of T metadata can be mapped to the following standards:
